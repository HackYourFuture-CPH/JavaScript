# HOMEWORK SUBMISSION

## TL;DR

- [ ] start any coding session from `main`.
- [ ] periodically keep your local `main` up to date with changes in the remote `main` (for example, when you merge a PR on GitHub, your remote `main` gets the new code added, but your local `main` does not).
- [ ] periodically merge the up-to-date local `main` into your new homework branch.
- [ ] always checkout to a new homework branch from `main`.
- [ ] write meaningful commit messages.
- [ ] before pushing, double check that your branch name is correct.
- [ ] if the branch name is not correct, you can checkout to a new, correct branch from the current branch - you will carry all the commits with you.
- [ ] stay patient. Slack, Google and ChatGPT are your best friends now.
- [ ] make the changes as per PR review in the appropriate branch, push the changes to the appropriate branch and merge the PR.

## Before you start the project

- Create a public project repository in your GitHub account (choose the option to add README.md).
- Clone the repository locally and open it in VS code.

## Before you start your homework

1. You are probably opening your project repo on the last weeks branch - make sure that any changes you have there are either committed and pushed, or stashed, or discarded - whatever you prefer. The point is to be mindful that:
   <br/> - you are most probably starting on a branch you last worked with, that is how VS Code works,
   <br/> - and there might be changes that you have not handled last time.
   <br/> - if you are about to start a new homework, you need to go to `main` first.

<br/>

2. Checkout to `main` and pull the latest changes from it. If you skip this step, you will get in trouble sooner or later.

<br/>

3. Checkout to your new homework branch, following the branch naming convention of `module-week/yourname`.
   See [allowed branch name prefixes](#allowed-branch-name-prefixes).

<br/>
‚ùó Always firstly checkout to the new homework branch from an updated `main`. Always.

<br/>

### Allowed branch name prefixes:

|                   |                   |                   |     |     |
| ----------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- | --- | --- |
| javascript2-week1 | javascript2-week2 | javascript2-week3 |     |
| javascript3-week1 | javascript3-week2 | javascript3-week3 |     |

### Examples

> ‚ùå javascript3/maria <br/>
> ‚ùå javascript2-week1-homework <br/>
> ‚ùå javascript3-week2 <br/>
> ‚úÖ javascript3-week3/maria

<br/>

## Completing and submitting your homework

1. Implement your homework. Be mindful of structuring and naming. Make sure you complete all the tasks listed for that week in your project description.

<br/>

2. Verify that your branch name is right. Commit and push your homework to the repository. If the branch name is not right, you can commit and checkout to a new, correct branch from the current branch - you will carry all the commits with you. Then you can push.

<br/>

3. Go to your project repository and create a Pull Request from your weekly homework branch to `main`.

<br/>

4. Post the link to the PR to your class channel and celebrate with your classmates! üéâ üíÉüèΩ üï∫üèæ ü•≥

<br/>

## After submitting your homework

1. Follow the PR to see the review and interact with the reviewer as well as make the suggested changes.

<br/>

2. When you have made changes to the code since the homework submission and review, push the changes and merge the PR.

<br/>

3. Update your local `main` with the merged changes in the remote `main`.

<br/>

4. Take a moment to celebrate your progress and be proud of your learning!
