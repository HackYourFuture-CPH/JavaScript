# Demo Day Presentation

Your team may choose to run a demo day to present your project and get feedback. If so, here's a brief to guide you through your 15-minute presentation. Each individual will have 40-minutes in total, broken down into 15-minutes for presenting and 25-minutes for discussions. Your presentation will be an opportunity to showcase your project, detail your weekly progress, and share your challenges and learnings.


## Presentation Structure (15 minutes)

### Introduction (2 minutes)
Briefly introduce your chosen project. (Refer to the "projects" folder for details.)

### Weekly Task Breakdown (10 minutes)

- JS2 Week 1: Discuss how you integrated Browser environment, DOM manipulation, and DOM event listeners into your project.
- JS2 Week 2: Describe your use of Array functions and Arrow functions.
- JS2 Week 3: Explain your implementation of Callback functions, Asynchronicity, and Scope.

### Project Summary (3 minutes)
Summarize what you learned from this project and how it ties together the concepts learned over JS2 and JS3.

### Feedback and Discussion Session (25 minutes)

After your presentation, there will be an open session for feedback and discussion. This is a valuable time to gain insights from your mentors and peers.

Tips for a Successful Presentation:
