# Demo Day Presentation

Your team may choose to run a demo day to present your project and get feedback. If so, here's a brief to guide you through your 15-minute presentation. Each individual will have 40-minutes in total, broken down into 15-minutes for presenting and 25-minutes for discussions. Your presentation will be an opportunity to showcase your project, detail your weekly progress, and share your challenges and learnings.


## Presentation Structure (15 minutes)

### Introduction (2 minutes)
Briefly introduce your chosen project. (Refer to the "projects" folder for details.)

### Weekly Task Breakdown (10 minutes)
For each week of the JS2 and JS3 modules, highlight:
- Your understanding and implementation of their concepts.
- Specific challenges you faced and how you overcame them.
- Any particular successes or insights you gained.

### Project Summary (3 minutes)
Summarize what you learned from this project and how it ties together the concepts learned over JS2 and JS3.

### Feedback and Discussion Session (25 minutes)

After your presentation, there will be an open session for feedback and discussion. This is a valuable time to gain insights from your mentors and peers.

Tips for a Successful Presentation:
- Be Clear and Concise: Focus on the key points and challenges of your project.
- Reflect on Your Learning Journey: Share how your understanding evolved over the weeks.
- Be Open to Feedback: This is a learning opportunity â€“ embrace the insights and suggestions from mentors and peers.

This is a suggested guideline for you to follow. We look forward to seeing your projects and hearing about your journey through the JS2 and JS3 modules in a way that works for you and your project. Good luck!
