## Homework week 1:
![Hacking](https://media.giphy.com/media/eCqFYAVjjDksg/giphy.gif)
## Before you start with the homework:

1. Watch: [What is programming](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/programming/intro-to-programming/v/programming-intro) Just watch the 2 min video, you do not have to do the entire JavaScript course (It could be useful later on though). 

## Eye Scream - We help where we can
Lets imagine that we have just started a cool new tech startup called **Eye Scream**. And lets imagine we even have this cool website url: [eye-scream.io](eye-scream.io) Now we are in business!

At **Eye Scream** we focus on solving real world problems. We venture into the world to help people, and by helping people, we create a sustainable business.

Cool lets see which problems we can find:

### The age calculator
You are talking to a friend who suddently looks at you and asks: "How old will you be in 2045?" You remember the year you were born and try to do some calculation: Born in 1987 + 3 that 1990. 90 - 40 is 50 + 5 thats 58. I will be 58! Wow that was a pain! Lets fix that by making some code that automatically does this!

Create two cariables called yearOfBirth and yearFuture. Assign these your own age and a futureYear.
What type will these two variables be? Now calculate the age and store that in a variable called age. Log this variable out.

### The dog age calculator
Now lets do the same but for a dog! Dogs age can either be measured in dog years or in human years, this we want to take into consideration! 
Like before lets create three variables but this time we call them dogYearOfBirth, dogYearFuture and dogYear. We add an extra variable called shouldShowResultInDogYears. If it is true we should show the result in dog years, if it is false we should show it in human years. What do we call this type of variable? 
Try some different numbers for dogYearOfBirth and dogYearFuture and see if the dogYear makes sense.


### House price estimator
Two of your friends are considering buying a house, but cannot figure out what the price should be. Your friends knows the width, the height and the depth of the house and the garden size. Lets help them figure out if they paid too much:

We have made our own formula for calculating the price of a house, it is as follows:
```js
housePrice = volumeInMeters * 2.5 * 1000 + gardenSizeInM2 * 300
```

Your friend Peter is considering a house with 8m wide, 10m deep and 10m high. The garden size is 100m2. The house costs 2.500.000.
Your friend Julia is considering a house with 5m wide, 11m deep and 8m high. The garden size is 70m2. This house costs 1.000.000.

Figure out if Peter and Julia is either paying too much or too little.


### Startup name generator
Making a startup name is difficult! Want to know the startup name but also the length because of logo restrictions.

Create two arrays called firstWords, secondWords and thirdWords. The arrays should have 10 elements containing strings of possible startup names. Some examples of first words could be: "Easy", "Awesome", "Corporate". Create a variable called numberOfStartupWords that controls the number of words in the created startup name. This variable can be either 1, 2 or 3. Create a variable called new startupName. Using a random index (you choose) of the arrays and concatenation of strings, create and log the new startup name. 




## Step 2:

* Create a page that contains jQuery
* Make something fadeIn and fadeOut when you click on something

## Step 3: **Some freeCodeCamp challenges:**

On freeCodeCamp.com please do the [Basic JavaScript](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript) exercises up and until the **"Shopping List"** exercise (there are some topics we did not cover but you can do it).

### How to hand in Homework:

```
steps:
• Create a new repository (name it something like hyf-javascript1) make sure you select the option: initialize with README
• inside this repository create a folder "week1"
• Upload the files you created on your computer inside the week1 folder, write a description for this "commit"
• Your repository should now contain all your homework files. Open the files from the github website to check if this all worked out
• Post the link on your classes slack channel
```

### Hint

If you solve the FreeCodeCamp challenges and they are new concepts to you and you would like to take a look at them later on in the program, Copy your answers from FCC in a .js file and upload them to Github in a repository for future reference. In this way you build your own little documentation, if you look back at them first try to understand what it does before you run them.
