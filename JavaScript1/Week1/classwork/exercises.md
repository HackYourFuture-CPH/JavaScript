Part 1
1. Create a special new folder called “pizza-exercise”
2. Inside the folder create a new html file called “index.html”
3. Also inside the folder create a new JavaScript file called “pizza.js”
4. Remember to Include the pizza.js script in the html file
5. Write a log statement, so you know that your javascript code is running:
```console.log("I love pizza");```
6. Create a variable to store the name of your favourite pizza
7. Create a variable to store the price of the pizza
8. Now log at statement to the console that will show the pizza man the entire pizza order in a language he understands, eg. like this:
```New pizza order: <name of pizza>. The price of the pizza is:  <price of pizza>```


Part 2
Now we will modify the program so that you can order multiple pizzas and also decide if the pizzas should be family size

1. Create a new variable to store the amount of pizzas you would like to order

2. Create a new variable to store whether or not you would to order a family size pizza.

3. Now write a formula to calculate the total price of your pizza order, and save it in a variable called totalPrice (if the pizza is family size the prize of the pizza is doubled.

4. Modify the log statement for the pizza man so it includes wether or not the pizza is family size, and now show the total price of the order
```New pizza order: <amount of pizzas> <family or not?> <name of pizza>. Total cost for the order is:  <total price>```

5. Try to change the price of the pizza and if the pizza should be family size, and then check if the total price is calculated correctly.
