# Lesson plan
```
> Focus on having lots of in class exercises.

> DONT teach everything, let the students investigate topics on their own aswell!

> Focus on how to read documentation, google answers and google errors!!

> Teach towards the students being able to solve the homework
```

Remember to add the code you wrote in the class to the relevant class branch's class work folder. If the branch has not been created just create and push it :) If you dont have access, write to one from the core team. You can see an example below!

To find examples of what teachers have taught before go to the class branches in the classwork folder, Fx [class 07](https://github.com/HackYourFuture-CPH/JavaScript/tree/class07/JavaScript1/Week1/classwork)

If you find anything that could be improved then please create a pull request! We welcome changes, so please get involved if you have any ideas!!!
